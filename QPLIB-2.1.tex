\subsection{Notation}\label{subsec:notation}

In mathematical optimization, a Quadratic Program (QP) is an optimization problem in which either the objective function, or some of the constraints, or both, are quadratic functions. More specifically, the problem has the form
%
\begin{align*}
 \min \textrm{or} \max \;\;
 & \half x^\top Q^0 x + b^0 x + q^0 \\
 \textrm{such that}\;\;
 & c^i_l \leq \half x^\top Q^i x + b^i x \leq c^i_u & i \in \Mcm, \\
 %
 & l_j \leq x_j \leq u_j & j \in \Mcn,  \\
 %
 \textrm{and}\;\;
 & x_j \in \mathbb{Z} & j \in \Mcz,
\end{align*}
%
%\begin{align*}
% \min \;\;
% & x^\top Q^0 x + b^0 x \\
% %
% & x^\top Q^i x + b^i x \leq c^i & i \in \Mcm \\
% %
% & l_j \leq x_j \leq u_j & j \in \Mcn  \\
% %
% & x_j \in \mathbb{Z} & j \in \Mcz
%\end{align*}
%
where
%
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\Mcn = \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ is the set of (indices) of variables, and $\Mcm = \{ 1, \ldots, m \}$ is the set of (indices) of constraints;
 %
 \item $x = [x_j]_{j = 1}^n$ %\in \RR^n$
is a finite vector of real variables;
 %
 \item $Q^i$ for $i \in \{ 0 \} \cup \Mcm$ are symmetric $n \times n$ real (Hessian) matrices: since one is only interested in the value of quadratic forms of the type $x^\top Q^i x$, symmetry can be assumed without loss of generality by just replacing off diagonal pairs $Q^i_{hk}$ and $Q^i_{kh}$ with their average $(Q^i_{hk} + Q^i_{kh}) / 2$;
 %
 \item $b^i$, $c_u^i$, $c_l^i$ for $i \in \{ 0 \} \cup \Mcm$, and $q^0$ are, respectively, real $n$-vectors and real constants;
 %
 \item $-\infty \leq l_j \leq u_j \leq \infty$ are the (extended) real lower and upper bounds on each variable $x_j$ for $j \in \Mcn$;
 %
 \item $\Mcm = \Mcq \cup \Mcl$ where $Q^i = 0$ for all $i \in \Mcl$ (i.e., these are the linear constraints, as opposed to the truly quadratic ones); and
 %
 \item the variables in $\Mcz \subseteq \Mcm$ are restricted to only attain integer values.
\end{itemize}
%
Due to the presence of integrality requirements on the variables and of quadratic constraints, this class of problems is often referred to as Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constraint Quadratic Program (MIQCQP). It will be sometimes useful to refer to the (sub)set $\Mcb =  \{ \, j \in \Mcz : l_j = 0 , u_j = 1 \, \} \subseteq \Mcz$ of the binary variables, and to $\Mcr = \Mcn \setminus \Mcz$ as the set of continuous ones. Similarly, it will be sometimes useful to distinguish the (sub)set $\Mcx = \{ \, j : l_j > -\infty \lor u_j < \infty \, \}$ of the box-constrained variables from $\Mcu = \Mcn \setminus \Mcx$ of the unconstrained ones (in the sense that finite bounds are not explicitly provided in the data of the problem, although they may be implied by the other constraints).

The relative flexibility offered by quadratic functions, as opposed e.g.~to linear ones, allows several reformulation techniques to be applicable to this family of problems in order to emphasize different properties of the various components. Some of these reformulation techniques will be commented later on; here we remark that, for instance, integrality requirements, in particular in the form of binary variables could always be ``hidden'' by introducing (nonconvex) quadratic constraints utilizing the celebrated relationship $x_j \in \{0, 1\} \iff x_j^2 = x_j$. Therefore, when discussing these problems some effort has to be made to distinguish between features that come from the original model, and those that can be introduced by reformulation techniques in order to extract (and algorithmically exploit) specific properties.
